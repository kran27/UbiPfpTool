# UbiPfpTool

Since Ubisoft removed custom profile pictures, people have been waiting for the feature's return. Wait no longer! With this tool, you can change your own profile picture, and upload it for others using the tool to see! Your Ubisoft credentials are used as account ownership verification, and are not stored anywhere locally or on the upload server.
